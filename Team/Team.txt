One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and take part in programming contests. Participants is usually offered several problems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they would implement a problem if at least both of them is sure about the so Lution. Otherwise, the friends won ' t write the problem ' s solution.

This contest offers n problems to the participants. For each problem we know, which friend was sure about the solution. Help the Friends find the number of problems for which they would write a solution. Input

The first input line contains a single integer n (1≤n≤1000)-the number of problems in the contest. Then n lines contain three integers each, each integer is either 0 or 1. If the first number in the line equals 1 and then Petya was sure about the problem ' s solution, otherwise he isn ' t sure. The second number shows Vasya ' s view on the solution, the third number shows Tonya ' s view. The numbers on the lines is separated by spaces. Output

Print a single integer-the number of problems the friends would implement on the contest. Sample Test (s)
